Zipped file downloads fast


Installing the zipped file into a sub folder.

Solution worked when I extracted it into c: drive

Running program for the first time. 
Very slow to load (first time)
Wants access to about 3 different things. Took about 10 minutes first time to load.


Using the zipped version, it founhd all my old libraries. Good!

Ran my hello blink program. works fine, why does it say it is not connected?

When you compile/upload a program nothing tells you it is running. After a bit this shows up in the bottom left corner
