Just trying the new Arduino IDE

1. Zipped file downloads fast


1. Installing the zipped file into a sub folder.

1. Solution worked when I extracted it into c: drive

1. Running program for the first time. 
Very slow to load (first time)
Wants access to about 3 different things. Took about 10 minutes first time to load.


1. Using the zipped version, it founhd all my old libraries. Good!

1. Ran my hello blink program. works fine, why does it say it is not connected?

1. When you compile/upload a program nothing tells you it is running for about 10 seconds. After a bit this shows up in the bottom left corner

1. Note: On re-compile/upload things are much faster.



1. Unloaded all sketches and loaded V2 again, took only about 40 seconds this time to load the software. That's good

1. Full computer reboot and loaded the V2IDE and also took only about 40 seconds to fully load.





1. Complaint:

I have many, many libraries, the old version used to remember the location in the examples menu of where you were. V2.0 always puts you at the top of the examples, meaning I have to scroll down ~5 pages of examples to get to my library.

which for my library portenta-pro-community-solutions is 23 mouse wheel scrolls since their is no page down command that works.

1. Ran one of my Machine Learning programs. Pltter works but does not show a line
