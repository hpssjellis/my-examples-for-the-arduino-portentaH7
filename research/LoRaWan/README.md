Hopefully more people in North America can try to get the LoRa Vision Shield working


 ## Connected, to Helium HNT eople Network in the US
 
See [helium-connected.ino](helium-connected.ino) for connection in the US to the Helium Crypto HNT People Network. 
Must login to the https://console.helium.com/devices  and add your device EUI then the other 2 variables are generated for you.

Basically used all the default settings and only MKRWAN.h
