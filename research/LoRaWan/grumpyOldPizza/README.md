All these files are for this very strange but working on the Portenta Vision Shield github

which can be installed very easily but going to your documents (sketchbook) and making a folder called hardware and inside that a folder called mycores and unzipping the above in that folder.

Note: Presently all this only works on a linux machine

The long verison is here
