# D100 Lidar Kit


As far as I can tell the website has no downloads   https://www.ldrobot.com/download/en/124

Found this useful datasheet   https://github.com/ldrobotSensorTeam/DeveloperKit/blob/master/D100Kit.md

And testing this old rplidar library  https://github.com/robopeak/rplidar_arduino which you need to unzip then zip the folder ```RPLidarDriver``` then install that.
