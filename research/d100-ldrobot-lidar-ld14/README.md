# D100 Lidar Kit


LDrobot youtube site is at   https://www.youtube.com/@ldrobot840/featured



Arduino forum here   https://forum.arduino.cc/t/error-compiling-for-board-arduino-mega-or-mega-2560/1119540


As far as I can tell the website has no downloads   https://www.ldrobot.com/download/en/124

Found this useful datasheet   https://github.com/ldrobotSensorTeam/DeveloperKit/blob/master/D100Kit.md


A manual that may be for it LD14   https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66579525/176196048-d3281842-04d8-40bf-89e5-80dc58a70afd.png

And testing this old rplidar library  https://github.com/robopeak/rplidar_arduino which you need to unzip then zip the folder ```RPLidarDriver``` then install that.
