Just looking for an easy testable wasy to do MQTT with the Arduino Portenta


This client works with the portenta.

Being a client it should be able to do both Subscribing and Publilshing. So it may have all that I need

https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoMqttClient


Would like to also get a Javascript page working to also test subscribing.


My Javs cript repository is at
