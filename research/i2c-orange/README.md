# a04 works to scan for I2C devices. With the portenta if I connect it through SCL1 and SDA1 irt fines all three I2C channels. not really sure how it does that.

```
Scanning...
I2C device found at address 0x08  !
I2C device found at address 0x24  !
I2C device found at address 0x60  !
done
```
weird only works on SDA1 and SCL1 not 0 or 2 for me


# A06  works to read what is at an adress. Run A04 to make sure the connection is OK first. DOes not see to use the info from a04 just needs to know that the connection is good.

Output from A06

Starting to get interesting. I took TJakels code and got it working with my code, however it did not seem to change the code dramtically and looks like several registers are locked.

Not yet a solution but it is interesting. Actually might be a solution since the orange light went off, but then when I disconnected it the orange LED came back on. But perhaps that is what happens and I need to get the bootloader burnt without cycling the power.

a09 also works same as the above wit no errors this time.

Still no luck with burning the bootloader
