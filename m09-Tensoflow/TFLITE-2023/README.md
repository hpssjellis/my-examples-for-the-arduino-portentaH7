# Issue the tFlite github by Google does not transfer to all Arduino's easily

Google tFlite githuyb is at  https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro



The Arduino version is at  https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro-arduino-examples   which works great for the Nano33BleSense REV1 but not any other Arduino








Using the fork at   https://github.com/josemqz/tflite-micro-arduino-portenta-h7  person detection now works. Thanks Jose
